\section{Conservation}

%todo

$$
\Omega = \frac{\sum_{x}{N_{x}}!}{\prod_{x}{N_{x}!}}
$$

$$
Entropy = ln{\Omega}
$$

\section{Identification of functional sites}

Functional differences between protein (sub-)families. Current practice:
\begin{itemize}
\item use multiple sequence alignment
\item look for conserved sites within (sub-)families (ignore sites that are 
overall conserved).
\end{itemize}

Example binders vs non-binders: sites crucial for binding (conserved) and sites 
determining non-binding (not conserved).

Take into account non-conserved sites as well! (comparing amino-acid 
compositions).

Sequence harmony: looks at differences instead of conservation.

\subsection{Conditional entropy}

Entropy of joint occurrence of value $i$ for event $x$ and value $j$ for event 
$y$:

$$
H(x,y) = - \sum_{i,j}{p(i,j) \cdot \log p(i,j)}
$$

and

$$
H(x) = - \sum_{i,j}{p(i,j) \cdot \log{\sum_{j}{p(i,j)}}}
$$
$$
H(y) = - \sum_{i,j}{p(i,j) \cdot \log{\sum_{i}{p(i,j)}}}
$$

so that $H(x,y) \leq H(x) + H(y)$

\subsection{Co-occurrence in practice}

Measure of mutial information, by relative entropy:

$H_{y}(x) = - \sum_{i,j}{something}$
